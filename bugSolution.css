To avoid the unexpected behavior due to specificity issues, you can use more explicit selectors or utilize the `!important` flag (though use it sparingly). 

Here's a possible solution:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.my-class div {
  color: red;
}

#my-id {
  color: green;
}

#my-id.my-class {
  color: purple !important; /*This ensures purple will be applied*/
}
```

By using `!important` we are explicitly overriding all previous selectors.  Always be aware of the implications before using `!important` as it can lead to hard-to-debug specificity conflicts later on.  A better approach might be to refactor your CSS selectors for greater clarity and maintainability.
