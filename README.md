# CSS Specificity Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error related to CSS specificity. The issue arises when combining ID and class selectors in a way that might lead to unexpected cascading behavior, which isn't always intuitive.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS code, and `bugSolution.css` demonstrates one possible way to avoid the problem.  The README explains the problem and solution in detail.

## Problem

The core issue stems from how CSS resolves specificity conflicts. While the intent might be to override styles from less specific selectors, the actual outcome can be different depending on the specificity weights of the selectors involved.

## Solution

This involves carefully reviewing selector order and, if necessary, adjusting selector specificity (more specific selectors override less specific ones) or using the `!important` flag with caution (generally not recommended unless absolutely necessary).
