The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.my-class div {
  color: red;
}

#my-id {
  color: green;
}

#my-id.my-class {
 color: purple; 
}
```

The issue arises when trying to target the element with both the `my-id` and `my-class` classes. While you might expect that `#my-id.my-class` overrides both `#my-id` and `.my-class div`, it may not always behave as expected due to specificity rules.

In this scenario, the color will be purple as expected. However, unexpected behavior might manifest if selectors with higher specificity are introduced.
